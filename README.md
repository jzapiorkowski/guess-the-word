# Guess the word!

Guess the word is my very first project that I created to learn React. This is a game called charades where the user has to guess what is shown on the screen at the moment. Player can change difficulty which has effect in displaying output.

There are three difficulties:

1.  **Easy** - shows length of a word along with color highlighting (red - bad, green - good)
2.  **Medium** - shows length of a word but without color highlighting
3.  **Hard** - doesn't show length of a word nor color highlighting

## You can check the demo [here](https://jzapiorkowski.github.io/guess-the-word/)

To run this app locally, first clone this repository. Then inside the project directory use one of the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
